# mnistcnn
handwritten digit classifier using with a convolutional neural network in keras.
  
As of now the the mnist images have been upscaled to 112x112 before training so that input images now are JPGs preprocessed to 112x112 instead of 28x28 which combines with strided convolutions to solve the issue of thin lines disappearing during preprocessing.

Currently restructuring the old code and working on ensuring compatablitiy with python 3.10
